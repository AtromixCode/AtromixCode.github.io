        <p>
          This simple a simple list of projects that I have done during my time
          at the University of Calgary. <u>NOTE</u> if you click on a demo or
          Github link, it will be impossible to come back to this page unless
          you use the back button. This is not covered by the "impossible to get
          stuck" since you are accessing an external site and will no longer be
          in this site. The demo links are there to be more realistic about the
          protfolio.

                A current project that I am working on with my capstone group.
                It is a web application used by the public to decide what
                charities get a donation from a company or an individual. It is
                being built with Vue in the front-end and Spring in the
                back-end. I mainly work as a front-end and QA developer. This
                project allowed me to work with Vue.js for the first time and
                realize it's advantages comapared to React

              <td>
                A web application based social network where users can go and
                rate different restaurants. It was built using React on the
                front-end and DJango in the back-end. I learned how DJango
                worked and how to code in Python.
